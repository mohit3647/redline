# Domain Docs

How the engineering skills should consume this repo's domain documentation when exploring the
codebase.

## Before exploring, read these

- **`CONTEXT.md`** at the repo root (does not exist yet)
- **`docs/adr/`**: read ADRs that touch the area you're about to work in. Currently:
  `0001-every-flag-cites-its-source.md`.

If any of these don't exist, **proceed silently**. Don't flag their absence; don't suggest creating
them upfront. `/domain-modeling` creates them lazily when terms or decisions actually get resolved.

## File structure

Single-context repo:

```
/
├── CONTEXT.md
├── docs/adr/
│   └── 0001-every-flag-cites-its-source.md
└── src/
```

## Use the glossary's vocabulary

When your output names a domain concept (an issue title, a refactor proposal, a hypothesis, a test
name), use the term as defined in `CONTEXT.md`. Don't drift to synonyms the glossary avoids.

If the concept isn't in the glossary yet, that's a signal: either you're inventing language the
project doesn't use (reconsider) or there's a real gap (note it for `/domain-modeling`).

## Flag ADR conflicts

If your output contradicts an existing ADR, surface it explicitly rather than silently overriding:

> _Contradicts ADR-0001 (every flag cites its source), but worth reopening because…_
